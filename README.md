# Arc.IO AFK Page Disclaimer

I forgot to write that there's a separate license for the Arc.IO AFK obfused code.

I will be providing it soon.

As I wait for the code owner to give me the license, keep in mind to keep these terms:

- Do not deobfuscate the code. Do not try it either.
- You are not allowed to distribute modified versions of the code.
- Do not use the code for sites other than Dashactyl. Just because there's Dashactyl doesn't mean it "isn't" Dashactyl.
- If asked by @Withdrawal#6969 (id: 365797140448018443) via Discord, you must remove the Arc.IO coin system.
